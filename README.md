# beemfit

Beemfit is a fitting routine for spectra measured with ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM), which detemines the Schottky Barrier height of a metal-semiconductor interface.  It linearizes the data and searches over all possible fits to find the best fit.  It outputs the Schottky barrier heigh and amplitude of the spectra, as well as the linearization parameters
